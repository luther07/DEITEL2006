Chapter 7: C Pointers
* Pointers are variables whose values are memory addresses.
* A variable name directly references a value and a pointer indirectly references a value.
* Pointers must be defined before they can be used
  int *countPtr, count;
* Include the letters ptr in pointer variable names.
* A pointer may be initialized to 0, NULL, or an address.
* NULL is a symbolic constant defined in <stddef.h> and several other headers.
* The value 0 is the only integer value that can be assigned directly to a pointer.
