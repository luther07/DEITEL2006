* DEITEL2006 is my project where I learn C programming.
* I'm using the book "C How to Program" 5th edition, as well as "Foundations of Computer Science: C Edition".
* The book is a quick and easy read so far.
* I've already used C++ in the past, but I've never bothered to learn C.
* I'm a student and my goal is to be a true software engineer.
* I don't feel that you can be a real software engineer withou a strong foundation in C/C++.
* I want to work with languages like Erlang, Scala, and OCaml, but I feel that no one will take me seriously without mastery of C/C++.
